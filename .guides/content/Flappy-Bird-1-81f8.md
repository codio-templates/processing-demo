## Flappy Bird 1 - Setup

{Launch Processing}(bash .guides/processing.sh 1)

## Open the File
You have to tell Processing the file you want to open. In the Processing window, click `File` then `Open...`. On the left towards the bottom of the list, click `workspace`. Double click on `FlappyBird`. Finally, open the `FlappyBird.pde` file. This should open five different files.

We are going to create a clone of the game Flappy Bird that makes use of the topics covered in this module. We will be using the Processing (a programming language based on Java) because creating an animation is much easier in Processing than in Java. The tutorial above uses a collection of Processing objects to make the game. We are going to create a composite class, an array of objects, and the lab will use five Processing files.

<summary><strong>Copying & Pasting</strong></summary>
  Unfortunately you will not be able to copy code from these pages and paste it into the Processing IDE. Processing is not running in your browser. Instead, it is running on a server somewhere across the internet. We use a virtual network computer (VNC) to show the Processing IDE in your browser. Because of this, you cannot copy/paste code. Using a VNC can also affect performance of the game.

The first thing to do is set up a generic game. **In the `FlappyBird` file**, Declare the `game` variable. In the `setup` method, set the size of the game and instantiate a `Game` object. In the `draw` method, set the background to the `background` attribute of `game`. Then call the `show` and `update` methods.

```java
Game game;

void setup() {
  size(400, 719);
  game = new Game();
}

void draw() {
  background(game.getBackground());
  game.show();
  game.update();
}
```

Processing should underline a few lines of code in red, indicating an error. We need to create the `Game` class with a few methods to make these error go away. **In the `Game` file**, declare the `Game` class. For now, give it the attribute `background`. In the constructor, load an image for the background. Then, make a getter for the `background` attribute. Declare the `show` and `update` methods, but do not write any code in the body. The underlined code should go away. The `show` method will be used to place images on the game window. The `update` method will be used to update the positions of the images in the game window.

```java
class Game {
  private PImage background;

  public Game() {
    background = loadImage("background.png");
  }

  public PImage getBackground() {
    return background;
  }
  
  public void show() {
    
  }
  
  public void update() {
    
  }
}
```

## Try It
Click the triangle button to run you program. You should see a 400 x 719 window appear with a background image. Close the window or click the square button to stop the program. **Note**, you need to manually save your work in Processing. Click `File` and then `Save`, or press `Ctrl + S` on the keyboard to save your work.

  <summary><strong>Code</strong></summary>
  Your code should look like this:
  
  ### `FlappyBird` File
  
  ```java
  Game game;

  void setup() {
    size(400, 719);
    game = new Game();
  }

  void draw() {
    background(game.getBackground());
    game.show();
    game.update();
  }
  ```
  
  ### `Game` File
  
  ```java
  class Game {
    private PImage background;

    public Game() {
      background = loadImage("background.png");
    }

    public PImage getBackground() {
      return background;
    }

    public void show() {

    }

    public void update() {

    }
  }
  ```
